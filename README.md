# WindTerm - Chocolatey package

A Quicker and better SSH/Telnet/Serial/Shell/Sftp client for DevOps.
See here for WindTerm: <https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm>

## Chocolatey package

This is the repository for packaging WindTerm to Chocolatey (<https://community.chocolatey.org/>)

## Specifictions

As it is a portable package, the user directory 'profiles' have to be in install directory so script create 'profiles' directory and add the good rights on it to permit WindTerm to modify it.
The scripts included in this package keep the 'profiles' folder on upgrade :)
